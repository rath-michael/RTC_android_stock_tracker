## Description
Welcome! My name is Michael Rath and this is my android stock tracking app I completed for Mobile Development 2 while attending Renton Technical College. Android app for tracking stock market data and trends. Displays real-time data and allows for up to the minute data visualization, history going back 1 year, and current market news.

## Technologies
Project is created with
* Java
* SQLite
* Room Database
* Retrofit
* REST API

## Roadmap
* As this was a classroom assignment, I have no further plans for additions or improvements
